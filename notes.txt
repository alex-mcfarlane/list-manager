# There can be multiple entries with the same email in Unsubscribers as users can unsubscribe more than once and
  we need a history of this.

# We will create a hash of all unsubscribes. When we send emails for all subscribers, we will make sure they are not in
  the unsubscribed. If they are, do not send the email and remove them from subscribed. It is best to do this logic
  during the email sending process as we are already looping through the list of subscribers.
